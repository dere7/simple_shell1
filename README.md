![Simple shell](shell.jpg)

**hsh** is simple implementation of a shell in C. It demonistrates the fundamentals of how shell works. Because it is so simple and intended for demonistration it has many limitations. These are: 
* Commands must be on a single line.
* Arguments must be separated with whitespace.
* No quoting 

## Running
```
gcc *.c -o hsh
./hsh
```
